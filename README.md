# `rust-webpack-template`

**Kickstart your Rust, WebAssembly, and Webpack project!**

This template comes pre-configured with all the boilerplate for compiling Rust
to WebAssembly and hooking into a Webpack build pipeline.

* `npm run start` -- Serve the project locally for
  development at `http://localhost:8080`.

* `npm run build` -- Bundle the project (in production mode)


## Using This Template

```sh
cargo install wasm-pack
```

Make sure to have the `wasm-pack build` sub-command, which was added recently.

```sh
npm init rust-webpack my-app
```
